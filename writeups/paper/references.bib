@misc{Landau1985,
	Abstract = {We ask in this book how children learn which of the words in their language encode which of the meanings. We accept as self-evident that any explanation of this learning must take nonlinguistic experience as relevant: When children hear words spoken by adults, they also observe objects, scenes, and events. Yet the issues here are quite perplexing because, at least to first inspection, heard words seem to map only very inexactly onto the child's observations of objects, scenes, and events.  In light of such difficulties, we tried to get some insight into how the child constructs the right mappings between words and the world by examining a situation in which the opportunities to observe the world are diminished: the case of langauge learning by congenitally blind children.  There is an evidently unshakable tradition which asserts that the blind must in principle be defective in their learning---of language, of space, and more.  We shall document that these a priori opinions cannot survive confrontation with the reality of language learning in congenitally blind children. Blind learners not only learn the forms of language but their meanings as well; their speech cannot be characterized as replete with "verbalisms" (the clinical term for blind learners' putative use of certain words as "sound without meaning").
