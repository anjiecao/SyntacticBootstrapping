In order to become fluent users of language, children must learn the names not only for concrete nouns, like “ball” and “apple”,  but also verbs like “eat” and “throw”. Learning the meaning of a verb presents a particular challenge to learners because the perceptual information about a verb’s meaning is complex -- it is ephemeral and temporally dynamic. How are children able to overcome this perceptual ambiguity in order to learn verb meanings? One of the central theoretical proposals is that children use syntactic information in a verb’s linguistic context to infer its meaning [@gentner2001individuation; @gentner2006verbs], a phenomenon known as  “syntactic bootstrapping” [@brown1957linguistic; @gleitman1990structural; @Landau1985; @naigles1990children]. For example, if a child hears the sentence “Mom pilked the apple”, the child can use knowledge about the language’s syntax to infer that “pilked” refers to an event where “Mom” is an agent acting on a patient, “the apple”, thereby constraining the hypothesis space of possible referents. A large body of empirical literature over the past twenty years has experimentally tested children’s ability to use syntactic information to infer verb meanings. The goal of the current paper is to synthesize this literature quantitatively using meta-analytic methods in order to evaluate the evidential value of this literature and understand theoretical and methodological moderators of the strength of the effect. 
The earliest work on syntactic bootstrapping demonstrated that children are able to use coarse-grain syntactic information to constrain hypotheses about a word’s meaning. Broad syntactic categories, like noun and verb, are probabilistically linked to semantic categories, like concrete things and actions. @brown1957linguistic demonstrated that children are able to make use of this information by presenting  children with sentences containing a novel word in different syntactic categories (e.g.,“Do you know what it means to sib?” (verb) vs. “Do you know what a sib is?” (noun)), and measuring whether children inferred the novel word to refer to an action or a concrete entity .  Subsequent studies demonstrated that children are also able to use more nuanced syntactic information to infer a word’s meaning. In particular, syntactic information provides information about the number of arguments a predicate takes. For example, verbs denoting a causative event (e.g. pushing) tend to take two noun arguments (a “pusher” and a “pushee”), whereas verbs denoting self-generated motion (e.g., waving) take only one noun argument (a “waver”). A large body of work has demonstrated that children are able to successfully map a predicate with two noun arguments (a transitive predicate) to a two-agent causative event, and a predicate with one noun argument (an intransitive predicate) to a non-causative event. 
In a canonical test of the syntactic bootstrapping phenomenon [@naigles1990children], children are simultaneously presented with two visual stimuli and an auditory sentence [@golinkoff1987eyes; @fernald1998rapid]. One visual stimulus depicts two characters doing an unfamiliar causative action to each other (e.g., a novel pushing motion), and the other depicts one or more characters doing an unfamiliar non-causative action (e.g., a  novel waving gesture). Children then hear a transitive (e.g.,  “”The duck is gorping the bunny”) or intransitive sentence (e.g., “The duck and the bunny are gorping”) with a novel verb, and then asked to find the novel verb (“Where’s the gorping now?”). Children’s fixation time or pointing selections are then measured. Evidence for syntactic bootstrapping is found when children look longer at the visual stimulus matching the syntactic structure of the sentence.  
The body of empirical literature investigating syntactic bootstrapping has demonstrated that children are able to successfully use syntactic information to bootstrap verb meaning given a range of linguistic (e.g. sentences used differed in their predicate types and word types) and visual stimuli (e.g. visual stimuli ranged from using animations with simple geometrical shapes to videos of human actors), and under a range of methodological implementations (e.g. the inclusion of practice phase, character-identification phase and the number of training-testing pair). These studies provide a binary description of the effect ("there is an effect") with various samples of children under various condition, but do not quantify the *strength* of the effect. Quantifying the strength of the effect allows researchers to assess the degree to which a learning strategy can be used by young learners to acquire verb meanings. Further, quantifying the size of an effect allows for the quantitative comparison to other proposed learning mechanisms for inferring the meaning of a word in a local context.
For example, children may be able to infer a word’s meaning by using co-occurrence statistics between words and referents ["cross-situational learning"; @smith2008infants; @yu2007rapid], or by relying on knowledge that each word in a language tends to only have one meaning ["mutual-exclusivity"; @lewis2020role; @markman1988children; @clark1987principle]. While these various learning strategies, and others, could in principle be applied to verbs, there is reason to think that these strategies may be better suited for concrete nouns, where the perceptual information is more stable and less complex. Consistent with this prediction, verbs are typically learned later in development than concrete nouns [e.g. @gentner1978relational;@childers200612;@schwartz1984words; @oviatt1980emerging;@childers2012children;@imai2008novel;@abbot2017role;@childers2002two, @frank2019variability]. Understanding the relative strength of various learning strategies for mapping word forms to word meanings could shed light on the source of the developmental lag in verb learning.
	
In addition to uncertainty about the overall size of the syntactic bootstrapping effect, there are a number of open theoretical questions about the nature of the effect. First, how does the strength of the effect change across development? One possibility is that the ability to use syntactic bootstrapping to learn novel verbs is unlearned or available early on in development as soon as the relevant syntactic information is represented, and the ability does not strengthen with development. An alternative possibility is that  the effect becomes stronger with maturation and experience. There are a range of reasons to think that the effect might strengthen. For example, with development, children’s vocabulary size increases, making it more likely they will know the nouns in the linguistic input containing a novel verb. If the effect becomes stronger with development, this would suggest that syntactic bootstrapping might become an increasingly powerful learning mechanism for children as they learn more words. [learning to learn stuff]  Prior work has examined the syntactic bootstrapping effect across different  age groups [e.g. @jin2015role; @gertner2012predicted] but it is unclear what the developmental trajectory of this effect looks like. Characterizing this developmental change is important to understanding the role that different word learning strategies play across the development. 
	
Second, how robust is the effect to different predicate types? Syntactic bootstrapping is theorized to be a general learning mechanism that could in principle be applied to the range of syntactic structures in children’s input. However, some experiments have found a syntactic bootstrapping effect for transitive sentences, but not intransitive sentences [@yuan2012counting; @arunachalam2010meaning], whereas others find the opposite pattern [@naigles1993first; @bunger2004syntactic]. Plausible explanations for both patterns have been proposed.  For example, the effect may be stronger for transitive sentences relative to intransitives, because intransitive sentences are relatively more flexible in their usage. Consider, for instance, the sentence “the girl is daxing.” This sentence could describe either a scene in which a girl is doing a transitive action (e.g. patting a boy) or a scene in which the girl is doing an intransitive action (e.g. jumping). In contrast, the sentence “the girl is daxing the boy” could only describe a scene in which the girl is doing a transitive action (e.g. patting the boy). This asymmetry may lead children to treat the syntactic information in sentences with transitive novel verbs as a stronger cue to a word’s meaning, relative to  sentences with an intransitive novel verb. On the other hand, intransitive sentences have fewer processing demands relative to transitive nouns [@lidz2009one], thereby potentially making syntactic bootstrapping easier for intransitive nouns.

The literature has also revealed conflicting findings about the robustness of syntactic bootstrapping to different types of noun phrase structures.In everyday discourse, people and objects  are often referred to by pronouns (e.g., “she”) instead of descriptive nouns (“the girl”). There is some evidence in the literature that semantically rich, descriptive nouns are beneficial for verb learning because the semantic content of the surrounding nouns can help scaffold the interpretation of the verbs [@arunachalam2011grammatical; @arunachalam2015let; @gillette1999human; @piccin2007nouns; @gleitman2005hard; @fisher1994better; @imai2008novel]. Others, however, have found that pronouns reduce processing load, thereby facilitating syntactic bootstrapping  [@lidz2009one; @childers2001role]. In the case of both predicate types and noun phrase structures, it is difficult to evaluate the robustness of syntactic bootstrapping to variability in the linguistic input without a clear understanding of the empirical pattern

One challenge in addressing these theoretical questions from the existing literature is that people make a range of different methodological decisions. As a result, it is not clear if the differences are due to method, sampling error, or theoretical moderators of interests. For example, researchers would adapt the experimental procedures based on the participants' age. Some studies included a practice phase or a character identification phase to familiarize the infants with the testing procedure and the agents involved in the events. However, doing so also lengthened the experiment and increased the task demands for infants because they need to stay focused for longer. Moreover, the onset of the linguistic stimuli and the visual stimuli differed across different designs. In some studies, the infants would see the events at the same time or soon after hearing the relevant sentences. In others, the sentences are accompanied by an irrelevant scene (e.g. a person on the phone talking or two people conversing). The lag between the linguistic stimuli and the visual stimuli is likely to increase the memory demand for the infants, and thus influences their performance at test. Finally, the structure of the experimental procedure also differs. Studies differed in terms of how many training-testing pairs they included. In some designs, the infants were exclusively trained and tested on one single novel verb. In others, they were given multiple training phases and were tested on multiple different novel verbs. Infants differed in the amount of experience they had with the novel verbs prior to the testing. These various implementational differences would further complicate answers to the theoretical questions in the literature.

The meta-analytic method provides a powerful analytic tool for quantifying theoretically important effects, and has increasingly been used in the language acquisition literature [@bergmann2018promoting]. Meta-analysis involves quantifying the size of an effect in individual experiments with a standardized measure (such as Cohen’s $d$), and then aggregating across studies statistically to estimate an overall effect size. Because a meta-analysis reflects estimates from many more participants than an individual study, the meta-analytic method has greater power to detect a true effect and precisely quantify it.  The meta-analytic method also allows researchers to explore moderators of an effect. Detecting a moderator to a small effect requires large sample sizes, but infant experiments, like those investigating syntactic bootstrapping, typically have small sample sizes  [@oakes2017sample;@bergmann2018promoting]. These small sample sizes mean that individual studies have low power to detect a true moderating effect, leading to literature with many null and conflicting effects for moderating influences. Meta-analysis addresses this limitation by providing a high-powered test of theoretically important moderators factors, as well as revealing variability in effect sizes due to methodological variability across studies. 

The plan for the paper is as follows. We first describe our method for conducting a meta-analysis of the syntactic bootstrapping effect. We then assess the evidential value of this literature by evaluating the influence of publication bias. Next, we characterize the size of the effect with respect to other word learning phenomena. We then examine the moderating influence of experience, sentence structure, and noun phrase structure on the syntactic bootstrapping effect, and the relationship between theoretical moderators and methodological variability in our meta-analytic data.  We find some evidence for publication bias in the syntactic bootstrapping literature, but that there is nevertheless a small syntactic bootstrapping effect. The effect is larger for transitive sentences, relative to intransitive sentences, but does not appear to be influenced by experience, noun phrase structure, and a range of methodological factors. In the General Discussion, we discuss the implications of our findings for theories of verb learning.
