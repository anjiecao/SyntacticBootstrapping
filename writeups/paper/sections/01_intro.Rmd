In order to become fluent users of language, children must learn the names not only for concrete nouns, like “ball” and “apple”,  but also verbs like “eat” and “throw”. Learning the meaning of a verb presents a particular challenge to learners because the perceptual information about a verb’s meaning is complex -- it is ephemeral and temporally dynamic. How are children able to overcome this perceptual ambiguity in order to learn verb meanings? One of the central theoretical proposals is that children use syntactic information in a verb’s linguistic context to infer its meaning [@gentner2001individuation, @gentner2006verbs], a phenomenon known as  “syntactic bootstrapping” [@brown1957linguistic; @gleitman1999structural; @Landau1985]. For example, if a child hears the sentence “Mom pilked the apple”, the child can use knowledge about the language’s syntax to infer that “pilked” refers to an event where “Mom” is an agent acting on a patient, “the apple”, thereby constraining the hypothesis space of possible referents. A large body of empirical literature over the past twenty years has experimentally tested children’s ability to use syntactic information to infer verb meanings. The goal of the current paper is to synthesize this literature quantitatively using meta-analytic methods in order to evaluate the evidential value of this literature and understand theoretical and methodological moderators of the strength of the effect. 

The earliest work on syntactic bootstrapping demonstrated that children were able to use course-grain syntactic information to constrain word meaning. @brown1957linguistic presented 3- to 5-year-old children with sentences containing a novel word in different syntactic categories (e.g.,“ Do you know what it means to sib?” (verb) vs. “Do you know what a sib is?” (noun)), and found that children were able to use the novel word’s grammatical class to infer the correct referent (action versus noun).  Subsequent studies demonstrated that children are able to use more nuanced syntactic information to infer a word’s meaning. In particular, this work focused on the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, and found that children were able to successfully map a transitive sentence to a two-agent causative event, and an intransitive sentence to a non-causative event. 

In the canonical version of the syntactic bootstrapping paradigm, children are presented with two visual stimuli simultaneously, along with a sentence [@naigles1990children]. One visual stimulus depicts two characters doing a causative action (e.g., pushing), and the other depicts one or more characters doing a non-causative action (e.g., waving). Children then hear a transitive (e.g.,  ”The duck is gorping the bunny”) or intransitive sentence (e.g., “The duck and the bunny are gorping”) with a novel verb, and then asked to find the novel verb (“Where’s the gorping now?”). Children’s fixation time or pointing selections are then measured.  A longer looking time for either of the screen indicated a match between the children’s conceptual representations of the novel verbs and the action on the screens. Evidence for syntactic bootstrapping is  found when children in the transitive condition look longer at the causal action than the non-causal action, and the children in the intransitive condition show the opposite pattern. This indicated that at this age children can interpret the meanings of novel verbs as informed by the syntactic structures in a surprisingly detailed way. 

Syntactic bootstrapping is just one of a range of other hypothesized learning mechanisms that children might use to infer the meaning of a word in a local context. For example, children may be able to infer a word’s meaning by using co-occurrence statistics between words and referents (cross-situational learning; ), or by relying on knowledge that each word in a language tends to only have one meaning [mutual-exclusivity; @lewis2020role]. While these various learning strategies, and others, could in principle be applied to verbs, there is reason to think that these strategies may be better suited for concrete nouns, where the perceptual information is less complex. Consistent with this prediction, verbs are typically learned later in development than verbs (e.g. XXX, @frank2019variability]. Importantly, however, little is known about the syntactic bootstrapping effect relative to other word learning strategies for solving the mapping problem. Estimating the size of the syntactic bootstrapping effect is critical to evaluating the role it plays in solve the mapping problem, and for building formal models of word learning.
	
In addition to uncertainty about the overall size of the syntactic bootstrapping effect, there are a number of open theoretical questions about the nature of the effect. First, how does the strength of the effect change across development? One possibility is that the ability to use syntactic bootstrapping to learn novel verbs is available early on in development as soon as the relevant syntactic information is represented, and the ability does not strengthen with development. An alternative possibility is that  the effect becomes stronger with maturation and experience. There are a range of reasons to think that the effect might strengthen. For example, with development, children’s vocabulary size increases, making it more likely they will know the nouns in the linguistic input containing a novel verb. Prior work has examined the syntactic bootstrapping effect within a few age groups (e.g., XXX), but it is unclear what the developmental trajectory of this effect looks like. Characterizing this developmental change is important to understanding the role that different word learning strategies play across the development. 
	
Second, how robust is the effect to different sentence structures? Syntactic bootstrapping is theorized to be a general learning mechanism that can be applied to a range of syntactic structures. However, some experiments have found a syntactic bootstrapping effect for transitive sentences, but not intransitive sentences [@yuan2012counting; @arunachalam2010meaning], whereas others find the opposite pattern [@naigles1993first, @bunger2004syntactic]. Plausible explanations for both patterns have been proposed.  For example, the effect may be stronger for transitive sentences relative to intransitives, because intransitive sentences are relatively more flexible in their usage. Consider the sentence “the girl is daxing.” This sentence could describe either a scene in which a girl is doing a transitive action (e.g. patting a boy) or a scene in which the girl is doing an intransitive action (e.g. jumping). In contrast, the sentence “the girl is daxing the boy” can only describe a scene in which the girl is doing a transitive action (e.g. patting the boy). This asymmetry may lead children to treat the syntactic information in sentences with transitive novel verbs as a stronger cue to a word’s meaning, than in sentences with an intransitive novel verb. On the other hand, intransitive sentences have fewer processing demands relative to transitive nouns [@lidz2009one], thereby potentially making syntactic bootstrapping easier for intransitive nouns. Evaluating these different theoretical explanations is difficult without a clear understanding of the empirical pattern. 

Third, how robust is the syntactic bootstrapping effect to different noun phrase structures? In everyday discourse, nouns are often referred to by pronouns (e.g., “she”) instead of descriptive nouns (“the girl”). There is some evidence in the literature that semantically rich, descriptive nouns are beneficial for verb learning because the semantic content of the surrounding nouns can help scaffold the interpretation of the verbs [@arunachalam2011grammatical; @arunachalam2015let; @gillette1999human; @piccin2007nouns; @gleitman2005hard; @fisher1994better; @imai2008novel], while others have found that pronouns reduce processing load, thereby facilitating syntactic bootstrapping  [@lidz2009one; @childers2001role]. 

The meta-analytic method provides a powerful analytic tool for quantifying theoretically important effects, and has increasingly been used in the language acquisition literature [@bergmann2018promoting]. Meta-analysis involves quantifying the size of an effect in individual experiments with a standardized measure (such as Cohen’s $d$), and then aggregating across studies statistically to estimate an overall effect size. Because a meta-analysis reflects estimates from many more participants than an individual study, the meta-analytic method has greater power to detect a true effect and precisely quantify it.  The meta-analytic method also allows researchers to explore moderators of an effect. Detecting a moderator to a small effect requires large sample sizes, but infant experiments, like those investigating syntactic bootstrapping, typically have small sample sizes  [@oakes2017sample;@bergmann2018promoting]. These small sample sizes mean that individual studies have low power to detect a true moderating effect, leading to literatures with many null and conflicting effects for moderating influences. Meta-analysis addresses this limitation by providing a high-powered test of theoretically important moderators factors, as well as revealing variability in effect sizes due to methodological variability across studies. 

<!-- By aggregating across many syntactic bootstrapping studies, we are able to conduct a high powered test of the robustness of this learning mechanism to different types of syntactic structures.  The present meta-analytic method allows us to clarify this conflicting empirical literature by directly examining the influence of noun phrase structure on the size of the syntactic bootstrapping effect. -->

The plan for the paper is as follows. We first describe our method for conducting a meta-analysis of the syntactic bootstrapping effect. We then assess the evidential value of this literature by evaluating the influence of publication bias. Next, we characterize the size of the effect with respect to other word learning phenomena. We then examine the moderating influence of experience, sentence structure, and noun phrase structure on the syntactic bootstrapping effect, and the relationship between theoretical moderators and methodological variability in our meta-analytic data.  We find some evidence for publication bias in the syntactic bootstrapping literature, but that there is nevertheless a small syntactic bootstrapping effect. The effect is larger for transitive sentences, relative to intransitive sentences, but does not appear to be influenced by experience, noun phrase structure, and a range of methodological factors. In the General Discussion, we discuss the implications of our findings for theories of verb learning.
