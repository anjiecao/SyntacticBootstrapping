To become fluent users of language, children must learn the names not only for concrete nouns, like “ball” and “apple”, but also for verbs like “eat” and “throw”. Learning the meaning of a verb presents a particular challenge because the perceptual information about a verb’s meaning is complex;  it is temporally dynamic and relational [@gentner2006verbs]. How are children able to overcome these complexities to learn verb meanings? One central theoretical proposal is that children use syntactic information in a verb’s linguistic context to infer meaning, a phenomenon known as “syntactic bootstrapping” [@brown1957linguistic; @gleitman1990structural; @Landau1985; @naigles1990children]. For example, if a child hears the sentence “Mom pilked the apple”, the child could use knowledge about the language’s syntax to infer that “pilked” refers to an event where “mom” is an agent acting on a patient, “the apple”, thus constraining the hypothesis space of possible meanings for the novel verb. A large body of empirical literature over the past thirty years has experimentally tested children’s ability to use syntactic information to infer verb meanings. The goal of the current paper is to synthesize this literature quantitatively using meta-analytic methods  in order to  evaluate the evidential value of this literature, the strength of the effect, and theoretical and methodological moderators. A precise description of the strength of the effect and moderating factors informs a more nuanced theory of the role syntactic bootstrapping plays in early verb learning and its relationship to other verb learning strategies.
 
The earliest work on syntactic bootstrapping demonstrated that children are able to use coarse-grain syntactic information to constrain hypotheses about a word’s meaning.
Broad syntactic categories, such as nouns and verbs, are probabilistically linked to semantic categories, like concrete things and actions. @brown1957linguistic demonstrated that children are able to make use of this information in word learning by presenting  children with sentences containing a novel word in different syntactic categories (e.g., “Do you know what it means to sib?” (verb) vs. “Do you know what a sib is?” (noun)), and measuring whether they inferred the novel word referred to an action or a concrete entity.  Subsequent studies demonstrated that children are also able to use more nuanced syntactic information to infer the meaning of a novel verb. In particular, at around two years of age, children are able to use the number of arguments a predicate takes to infer the predicate's referent. For example, verbs denoting a causative event (e.g., pushing) tend to take two noun arguments (a “pusher” and a “pushee”), whereas verbs that denote self-generated motion (e.g., waving) take only one noun argument (a “waver”). A large body of work has demonstrated that children are able to successfully map a predicate with two noun arguments (a transitive predicate) to a two-agent causative event, and a predicate with one noun argument (an intransitive predicate) to a one-agent non-causative event [e.g., @arunachalam2019semantic; @gertner2012predicted; @hirsh1996young; @messenger2015learning; @naigles1990children; @yuan2009really].

The ability to use syntactic information to infer a novel verb meaning is typically tested in a paradigm in which children are presented simultaneously with two visual stimuli and an auditory sentence [@golinkoff1987eyes; @fernald1998rapid]. Canonically [e.g., @naigles1990children], one visual stimulus depicts two characters engaging in an unfamiliar causative action to each other (e.g., a novel pushing motion), and the other depicts one or more characters engaging in an unfamiliar non-causative action (e.g., a novel waving gesture). Children then hear a transitive (e.g., “The duck is gorping the bunny”) or intransitive sentence (e.g., “The duck and the bunny are gorping”) that contains a novel verb, and then are asked to find the corresponding scene (“Where’s gorping now?”). Children’s fixation time or pointing selections are measured. Evidence that children are able to “bootstrap” verb meanings from syntax is found when they look longer at the visual stimulus that matches the syntactic structure of the sentence. Studies with this general design have found that children are able to use syntactic information to infer verb meaning given a range of linguistic and visual stimuli, and in a variety of experimental manipulations. 

Importantly,  although these studies provide a binary description of the effect (“children can bootstrap verb meanings from syntax”), they do not quantify the *strength* of the effect. Quantifying the strength of the effect allows researchers to assess the degree to which a learning strategy is likely to be used by young learners to acquire verb meanings. Further, it allows for the quantitative comparison to other proposed learning strategies for inferring the meaning of a word in a local context. For example, children may be able to infer a word’s meaning by using co-occurrence statistics between words and referents ["cross-situational learning"; @smith2008infants; @yu2007rapid], or by relying on knowledge that each word in a language tends to only have one meaning ["mutual-exclusivity"; @clark1987principle; @lewis2020role; @markman1988children]. Understanding the relative strength of various learning strategies for mapping word forms to meanings could shed light on the source of differences in word learning abilities across children of various ages and developmental trajectories.
	
In addition to uncertainty about the overall strength of the syntactic bootstrapping effect, there are a number of open theoretical questions about the nature of the effect. First, how does the strength of the effect change across development? One possibility is that the ability to use syntactic bootstrapping to learn novel verbs is unlearned or available early in development once the relevant syntactic information is represented, and the ability does not strengthen with development [@fisher2020developmental; @gleitman1990structural]. An alternative possibility is that the effect becomes stronger with maturation and experience. There are a range of reasons to think that the effect might strengthen over development. For example, with development, children’s vocabulary size increases, making it more likely they will know the nouns in the linguistic input containing a novel verb. If the effect becomes stronger with development, this would suggest that syntactic bootstrapping may become an increasingly powerful learning strategy for children as they learn more words. Prior work has examined the syntactic bootstrapping effect across several age groups [e.g., @gertner2012predicted; @jin2015role], but the shape of the developmental trajectory is not clear.

Second, how robust is the effect for different syntactic structures? Syntactic bootstrapping is theorized to be a general learning strategy that could in principle be applied to a range of syntactic structures in children’s input. However, some experiments have found a syntactic bootstrapping effect for transitive sentences but not intransitive sentences [@yuan2012counting; @arunachalam2010meaning], whereas others find the opposite pattern [@naigles1993first; @bunger2004syntactic]. Plausible explanations for both patterns have been proposed. For example, the effect may be stronger for transitive sentences relative to intransitives because intransitive sentences are relatively more flexible in their usage. Consider, for instance, the sentence “the girl is daxing.” This sentence could describe either a scene in which a girl conducts a transitive action (e.g., patting the boy) or a scene in which the girl  performs an intransitive action (e.g., jumping). In contrast, the sentence “the girl is daxing the boy” could only describe a scene in which the girl enacts a transitive action (e.g., patting the boy). This asymmetry may lead children to treat the syntactic information in sentences with a transitive  verb as a stronger cue to a verb’s meaning relative to sentences with an intransitive verb. On the other hand, the effect may be stronger for intransitive verbs, relative to transitive verbs, because intransitives have fewer noun arguments and therefore fewer processing demands [@lidz2009one]. Thus, although syntactic bootstrapping is assumed to be a general verb learning strategy, its robustness to different predicate types remains an open question.

The literature has also revealed conflicting findings about the robustness of syntactic bootstrapping to different types of noun phrase structures. In everyday discourse, people and objects are often referred to by pronouns (e.g., “she”) instead of descriptive nouns (“the girl”). There is some evidence that semantically rich, descriptive nouns are beneficial for verb learning because the semantic content of the surrounding nouns can scaffold the interpretation of a verb [@arunachalam2015let;@gleitman2005hard]. Others, however, have argued that pronouns support syntactic bootstrapping because they reduce processing load, relative to descriptive nouns [@lidz2009one; @childers2001role].  Pronouns may also support syntactic bootstrapping in English because they are case-marked (e.g., female agent = "she"; female patient = "her"), potentially providing children with an additional, redundant cue about the syntactic roles of nouns arguments [@yuan2012counting]. In the case of both predicate types and noun phrase structures, it is difficult to evaluate the robustness of syntactic bootstrapping to variability in the linguistic input without a clear understanding of the empirical pattern. 

One challenge in addressing these theoretical questions is the range of ways the syntactic bootstrapping effect has been tested across the literature. The presence of methodological variability means that it is not clear if observed differences in outcomes are due to methodological factors, sampling error, or theoretical moderators of interests.  For example, across studies, there is variability in the relative onset of the linguistic and visual stimuli. In some studies, children see the events at the same time or soon after hearing the relevant sentences [@naigles1990children; @gertner2012predicted], while in others, the sentences are accompanied by an irrelevant scene (e.g., a person on the phone talking or two people conversing) followed by the target visual stimuli [@yuan2009really; @arunachalam2010meaning]. The lag between the linguistic stimuli and the visual stimuli likely increases the memory demands of the task, and could influence children's ability to identify the correct referent. Critically, if this methodological difference co-varies with the age of children tested, it may be difficult to draw conclusions about the developmental trajectory of the effect across studies. 

The meta-analytic method provides a powerful analytic tool for quantifying theoretically important effects, and it has increasingly been applied in the language acquisition literature [@bergmann2018promoting; @lewis2020role; @rabagliati2019profile; @cristia2018can]. Meta-analysis involves quantifying the size of an effect in individual experiments with a standardized measure (such as Cohen’s $d$), and then aggregating across experiments statistically to estimate an overall effect size. Because a meta-analysis reflects estimates from many more participants than any individual study, the meta-analytic method has greater power to detect a true effect and precisely quantify it.  The meta-analytic method also allows researchers to explore moderators of an effect. Detecting a moderator to a small effect requires large sample sizes, but infant experiments, like those investigating syntactic bootstrapping, typically have small sample sizes  [@oakes2017sample;@bergmann2018promoting]. These small sample sizes mean that individual studies have low power to detect moderating effects, potentially leading to a literature with many null and conflicting effects. Meta-analysis addresses this limitation by providing a higher-powered test of theoretically important factors, as well as revealing variability in effect sizes due to methodological variability across studies. 

The plan for this paper is as follows. We first describe our method for conducting a meta-analysis of the syntactic bootstrapping effect. We then assess the evidential value of this literature by evaluating the influence of publication bias. Next, we examine the moderating influence of development, predicate type, and noun phrase structure on the syntactic bootstrapping effect, and the relationship between theoretical moderators and methodological variability in our meta-analytic data. We then characterize the size of the effect with respect to other word learning phenomena. We find some evidence for publication bias in the syntactic bootstrapping literature, but that there is nevertheless a small syntactic bootstrapping effect. The effect is larger for transitive sentences, relative to intransitive sentences, but does not appear to be influenced by development, noun phrase structure, or a range of methodological factors. In the General Discussion, we discuss the implications of our findings for theories of verb learning and recommendations for future work on this phenomenon.
