abstract: |
  How do children infer the meaning of a novel verb? One proposal is that children are able to rely on  syntactic information in a sentence to help infer a verb’s meaning, a phenomenon known as “syntactic bootstrapping” (Naigles, 1990). For example, if a child hears the sentence “The bunny is gorping the duck”, and knows the words “bunny” and “duck”, then the child can rely on the syntactic information that "gorping" takes two noun arguments to infer "gorping" refers to the bunny causing the duck to move. Here, we present a quantitative synthesis of the syntactic bootstrapping effect in order to understand the strength of the effect, its developmental trajectory and generalizability.  Using meta-analytic methods, we find a small, reliable syntactic bootstrapping effect (d = .24). The effect is comparable in size to cross-situational learning and sound symbolism but smaller than mutual-exclusivity and gaze-following. Further, we find that the effect does not strengthen with development, and is present only for  studies using transitive sentences. An examination of a range of methodological factors suggests that the effect is not strongly influenced by methodological implementation. In the General Discussion, we discuss implications of our findings for theories of verb learning and make recommendations for future research.
